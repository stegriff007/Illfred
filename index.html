        <span class="text">On September 11 th 2001, images of the attack on the World Trade Center flashed across Television
screens around the world. Paralyzed by a deadly cocktail of emotion, illFred stood in front of his
television screen as hopeless and desperate as the rest of the world. As he watched people plunge to
their deaths from the top of the towers, tears of anger, despair, fear and hopelessness welled in his
eyes. After realizing that the horrific scenes he was witnessing were not part of a tragic movie or vivid
nightmare, the air that felt like it was abruptly vacuumed from his lungs, rushed into his mouth as he
gasped and caused him to gag. From that moment on, nothing would ever be the same.<br>
The years that followed introduced an era of fear and uncertainty. It didn’t take long before America
began to exhibit signs and symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Paranoia was prevalent
throughout the Internet, various media outlets, airports, schools, public arenas and private sectors. The
idea of embracing other cultures was replaced by intolerance. Before long, the dark veil of intolerance
was lifted and the intolerant were empowered and encouraged to practice discrimination candidly.
America demonstrated that its roots of hatred were still alive and growing.<br>
In the year 2017, America continues to be plagued by corruption, bigotry, injustice, hatred and
destruction. The systems that were set in place to serve the needs and protect the rights of the people
have failed time and time again. While some people live lavishly, others suffer socio-economic
disparities. Crime syndicates such as &lt;some&gt; street gangs, hate groups, religious extremists, law
enforcement officials and the likes of them, terrorize communities. Media outlets distort the facts to
align with their agendas. Leaders deceive and mislead, all-the- while inciting dissension amongst the
masses. Although these symptoms are not unique to America and seem to be a part of a world-wide
epidemic that is infecting the global populous, it is spreading throughout the U.S. rapidly and has already
rendered fatal outcomes.<br>
Terrifying images continue to flash across television and computer screens throughout. The real world is
filled with tragic scenes that horrific nightmares are made of. Although the world continues down it’s
destructive course, illFred has moved passed the paralysis and is using his voice to lead a group of
“illites” in the opposite direction. He is leading the march against social injustice and cultivating a culture
of hope, equality, justice and peace.<br>
Join illFred in the fight against oppressors. Help him foster a culture of moral aptitude and resist the
declining trend. Join the cultural illites as they seek to fight for justice and reform the “Trumped Nation”
